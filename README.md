# Cross-Entropy Survival Theory (CEST) Analysis

A comprehensive mathematical framework for modeling population survival dynamics using information theory, Fourier analysis, and Laplace transforms.

## Overview

This project implements Cross-Entropy Survival Theory (CEST), a novel approach to modeling cat population dynamics under environmental stress. The theory combines:

- **Cross-entropy measures** to quantify resource-requirement mismatches
- **Fourier analysis** for frequency domain insights
- **Laplace transforms** for stability analysis
- **Early warning indicators** for population collapse prediction

## Key Features

- Real-time population dynamics simulation
- Resource mismatch quantification using information theory
- Frequency domain analysis of survival patterns
- Stability analysis across multiple scenarios
- Early warning system for population threats
- Comprehensive visualization and reporting

## Installation

### Requirements

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scipy pandas
```

### Running the Analysis

```bash
python app.py
```

## Model Components

### 1. Cross-Entropy Survival Theory
The core theory quantifies survival probability based on resource availability mismatches:

```
S(t) = exp(-∫[0,t] D(τ) dτ)
```

Where `D(t)` represents the cross-entropy between required and available resources.

### 2. Resource Variables
The model tracks four critical resources:
- **Protein** (food availability)
- **Water** (hydration needs)
- **Temperature** (thermal regulation)
- **Shelter** (protection requirements)

### 3. Analysis Methods
- **Fourier Analysis**: Identifies cyclical patterns in resource stress
- **Laplace Analysis**: Evaluates system stability across scenarios
- **Population Dynamics**: Simulates population changes over time
- **Early Warning Indicators**: Detects approaching critical thresholds

## Output Files

The analysis generates several output files:

- `CEST_results_[timestamp].json` - Complete numerical results
- `CEST_population_summary_[timestamp].csv` - Key metrics summary
- `CEST_Analysis_Report_[timestamp].md` - Detailed analysis report
- `CEST_comprehensive_analysis.png` - Visualization plots

## Model Parameters

Key configurable parameters:

- **Adaptation Rate (k)**: 0.3 day⁻¹ (population response speed)
- **Sensitivity (α)**: 0.5 (stress response sensitivity)
- **Critical Threshold**: 2.0 (survival threshold)
- **Time Resolution**: 0.1 days (simulation granularity)

## Mathematical Foundation

The model is based on information-theoretic principles where survival probability decreases exponentially with accumulated cross-entropy between resource requirements and availability. This approach provides:

1. **Quantitative framework** for survival analysis
2. **Predictive capabilities** for population dynamics
3. **Early warning systems** for critical transitions
4. **Multi-scale analysis** through transform methods

## Use Cases

- Wildlife population management
- Conservation planning
- Environmental impact assessment
- Resource allocation optimization
- Ecosystem stability analysis
